Generate plots with Rokâ€™s fitted parameters. First, pick the lowest Gamma_tun and the highest Gamma_tun, and take Gamma = 10^10 Hz. For a fixed parameter set, produce a 6-panel plot, with the 6 panels arranged vertically, all showing functions of the on-site energy (a): Shiba minigap (b) even ground-state charge, odd ground-state charge, their difference, (c ) equilibrium ground-state population (d) quantum capacitance, (e) tunneling capacitance, (f) inverse Sis resistance.
